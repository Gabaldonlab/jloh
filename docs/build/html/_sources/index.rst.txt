Welcome to the JLOH documentation
=================================

**What is JLOH?**

**JLOH** (`/jay'lo/`) is a tool to extract, filter, and analyse loss of heterozygosity (LOH) blocks based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (VCF), read mapping information (BAM), and a reference genome sequence (FASTA). 

A publication is available in the Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal (`Schiavinato et al., 2023 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2023.11.003>`_).
